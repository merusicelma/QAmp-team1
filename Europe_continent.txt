Europe is a continent which is also recognised as part of Eurasia, located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere 
and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere.[10] Comprising the westernmost peninsulas of the continental landmass of Eurasia,
it shares the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Asia and Africa. It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the 
north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south and Asia to the east. Europe is commonly considered 
to be separated from Asia by the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the Greater Caucasus, the 
Black Sea and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Although much of this border is over land, Europe is almost always recognised 
as its own continent because of its great physical size and the weight of its history and traditions.
