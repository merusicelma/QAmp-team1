Europe is a continent which is also recognised as part of Eurasia, located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere
and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere.[10] Comprising the westernmost peninsulas of the continental landmass of Eurasia,
it shares the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Asia and Africa. It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the
north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south and Asia to the east. Europe is commonly considered
to be separated from Asia by the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the Greater Caucasus, the
Black Sea and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Although much of this border is over land, Europe is almost always recognised
as its own continent because of its great physical size and the weight of its history and traditions.

It shares land borders with Sweden to the west, Russia to the east, Norway to the north, and is defined by the Gulf of Bothnia

Italy
Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a country consisting of a peninsula delimited by the Alps and several islands 
surrounding it, whose territory largely coincides with the homonymous geographical region. 
Italy is located in the centre of the Mediterranean Sea, in Southern Europe; it is also considered part of Western Europe.
A unitary parliamentary republic with Rome as its capital and largest city, the country covers a total area of 301,230 km2 
and shares land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, as well as the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino.
Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland (Campione) and a maritime exclave in Tunisian waters (Lampedusa). With around 60 million
inhabitants, Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union. 


Switzerland
Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a landlocked country at the confluence of Western, Central and Southern Europe. The country is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons, with federal
uthorities based in Bern. Switzerland is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. It is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, the
Alps and the Jura, spanning a total area of 41,285 km2 (15,940 sq mi) and land area of 39,997 km2 (15,443 sq mi). Although the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately 8.5 million
is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities and economic centres are, among them ZÃ¼rich, Geneva, Basel and Lausanne. These cities are home to several offices of international organisations such as
the WTO, the WHO, the ILO, the seat of the International Olympic Committee, the headquarters of FIFA, the UN's second-largest office, as well as the main building of the Bank for International Settlements. The main
international airports of Switzerland are also located in these cities.
